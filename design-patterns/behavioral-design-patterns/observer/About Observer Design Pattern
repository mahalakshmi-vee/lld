About Observer Design Pattern:

1. Notify changes to multiple objects.

2. Observer design pattern used to establish a one to many dependency between objects, so that when one object (the subject) changes state,
all it dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically.

3. This pattern is useful for implementing distributed event-handling systems.

4. When the Observable state changes all the observers are notified and updated automatically.
